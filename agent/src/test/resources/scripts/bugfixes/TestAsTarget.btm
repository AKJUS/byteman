# Test for BYTEMAN-325. Check that AS TARGET rules are injected
# and type checked using the class/interface mentioned in the rule
# rather than the class the rule is injected into.
#
# NOTE: This test expects to see 2 type check errors for the AS TARGET rule on
# i/face Strings that tries to reference method append. These occur whether
# the trigger class is StringsLinked or StringsArray. It should expects to see a
# type check error for the AS TRIGGER rule on i/face Strings when injecting into
# class StringsArray since it also tries to reference method append.
